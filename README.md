MyHashTable
implementation of a hash table. provides methods for inserting, retrieving, and removing key-value pairs, checking a value and getting a key associated with a value. 

MyTestingClass
 class representing objects to be used as keys in the hash table. It overrides the hashCode() method to provide a custom hash code implementation based on the object's id.

The main method in MyHashTable class is provided to test the functionality of the hash table. It generates random integer keys and inserts corresponding values into the hash table. Then prints the bucket sizes 

MyBST
MyBST is an implementation of a Binary Search . provides methods for inserting, retrieving, deleting key-value pairs, obtaining the size of the tree and iterating over its keys in ascending order.

Main is a demonstration class showcasing the usage of `MyBST` and `MyHashTable`.
demonstrates the functionality of `MyBST` and `MyHashTable`. It creates a BST, inserts key-value pairs, performs operations like retrieving and deleting, iterates over keys, and creates a hash table with random keys.
